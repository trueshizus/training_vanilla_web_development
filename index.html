                <h3>Angular JS</h3>
                <p>AngularJS (commonly referred to as "Angular.js" or "AngularJS 1.X") is a JavaScript-based open-source front-end
                    web application framework mainly maintained by Google and by a community of individuals and corporations
                    to address many of the challenges encountered in developing single-page applications. The JavaScript
                    components complement Apache Cordova, the framework used for developing cross-platform mobile apps. It
                    aims to simplify both the development and the testing of such applications by providing a framework for
                    client-side model–view–controller (MVC) and model–view–viewmodel (MVVM) architectures, along with components
                    commonly used in rich Internet applications. In 2014, the original AngularJS team began working on Angular
                    (Application Platform).</p>

                <h3>React</h3>
                <p>In computing, React (sometimes styled React.js or ReactJS) is an open-source (with caveats) JavaScript library
                    for building user interfaces.</p>
                <p>It is maintained by Facebook, Instagram and a community of individual developers and corporations.</p>
                <p>React allows developers to create large web-applications that use data that can change over time, without
                    reloading the page. It aims primarily to provide speed, simplicity and scalability. React processes only
                    user interfaces in applications. This corresponds to View in the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern,
                    and can be used in combination with other JavaScript libraries or frameworks in MVC, such as AngularJS.</p>

                <h3>Vue.js</h3>
                <p>Vue.js (commonly referred to as Vue; pronounced /vjuː/, like view) is an open-source progressive JavaScript
                    framework for building user interfaces. Integration into projects that use other JavaScript libraries
                    is made easy with Vue because it is designed to be incrementally adoptable. Vue can also function as
                    a web application framework capable of powering advanced single-page applications.</p>
                <p>According to a 2016 JavaScript survey, Vue has an 89% developer satisfaction rating. It accumulates around
                    95 GitHub stars per day, and is the 10thost Ptarred project on GitHub of all time.</p>

                <h3>Polymer</h3>
                <p>Polymer is an open-source JavaScript library for building web applications using Web Components. The library
                    is being developed by Google developers and contributors on GitHub. Modern design principles are implemented
                    as a separate project using Google's Material Design design principles.</p>
                <p>Polymer is used by a number of Google services and websites, including the redesigned YouTube, YouTube Gaming,
                    the redesigned Google Earth, Google I/O websites, Google Play Music, redesign of Google Sites and Allo
                    for web.

                <h3>Elm</h3>
                <p>Elm is a domain-specific programming language for declaratively creating web browser-based graphical user
                    interfaces. Elm is purely functional, and is developed with emphasis on usability, performance, and robustness.
                    It advertises "no runtime exceptions in practice," made possible by the Elm compiler's static type checking.</p>

                <h3>Ruby on Rails</h3>
                <p> Ruby on Rails, or simply Rails, is a server-side web application framework written in Ruby under the MIT
                    License. Rails is a model–view–controller (MVC) framework, providing default structures for a database,
                    a web service, and web pages. It encourages and facilitates the use of web standards such as JSON or
                    XML for data transfer, and HTML, CSS and JavaScript for display and user interfacing. In addition to
                    MVC, Rails emphasizes the use of other well-known software engineering patterns and paradigms, including
                    convention over configuration (CoC), don't repeat yourself (DRY), and the active record pattern.</p>

                <h3>Django</h3>
                <p>Django (/ˈdʒæŋɡoʊ/ JANG-goh) is a free and open-source web framework, written in Python, which follows the
                    model-view-template (MVT) architectural pattern. It is maintained by the Django Software Foundation (DSF),
                    an independent organization established as a 501(c)(3) non-profit.</p>
                <p>Django's primary goal is to ease the creation of complex, database-driven websites. Django emphasizes reusability
                    and "pluggability" of components, rapid development, and the principle of don't repeat yourself. Python
                    is used throughout, even for settings files and data models. Django also provides an optional administrative
                    create, read, update and delete interface that is generated dynamically through introspection and configured
                    via admin models.</p>
                <p>Some well-known sites that use Django include the Public Broadcasting Service, Instagram, Mozilla, The Washington
                    Times, Disqus, Bitbucket, and Nextdoor. It was used on Pinterest, but later the site moved to a framework
                    built over Flask.</p>

                <h3>Express</h3>
                <p>Express.js, or simply Express, is a web application framework for Node.js, released as free and open-source
                    software under the MIT License. It is designed for building web applications and APIs. It is the de facto
                    standard server framework for Node.js.</p>
                <p>The original author, TJ Holowaychuk, described it as a Sinatra-inspired server, meaning that it is relatively
                    minimal with many features available as plugins. Express is the backend part of the MEAN stack, together
                    with MongoDB database and AngularJS frontend framework.</p>

                <h3>ASP.NET</h3>
                <p>ASP.NET is an open-source server-side web application framework designed for web development to produce dynamic
                    web pages. It was developed by Microsoft to allow programmers to build dynamic web sites, web applications
                    and web services.</p>
                <p>It was first released in January 2002 with version 1.0 of the .NET Framework, and is the successor to Microsoft's
                    Active Server Pages (ASP) technology. ASP.NET is built on the Common Language Runtime (CLR), allowing
                    programmers to write ASP.NET code using any supported .NET language. The ASP.NET SOAP extension framework
                    allows ASP.NET components to process SOAP messages.</p>
                <p>ASP.NET's successor is ASP.NET Core. It is a re-implementation of ASP.NET as a modular web framework, together
                    with other frameworks like Entity Framework. The new framework uses the new open-source .NET Compiler
                    Platform (codename "Roslyn") and is cross platform. ASP.NET MVC, ASP.NET Web API, and ASP.NET Web Pages
                    (a platform using only Razor pages) have merged into a unified MVC 6.</p>

                <h3>Java</h3>
                <p>Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented,
                    and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let
                    application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on
                    all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java applications are typically compiled
                    to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture. As of
                    2016, Java is one of the most popular programming languages in use, particularly for client-server web
                    applications, with a reported 9 million developers. Java was originally developed by James Gosling at
                    Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995 as a core
                    component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The language derives much of its syntax from C and C++,
                    but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.</p>
                <p>The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally
                    released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of
                    the Java Community Process, Sun relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GNU General Public
                    License. Others have also developed alternative implementations of these Sun technologies, such as the
                    GNU Compiler for Java (bytecode compiler), GNU Classpath (standard libraries), and IcedTea-Web (browser
                    plugin for applets).</p>
                <p>The latest version is Java 8 which is the only version currently supported for free by Oracle, although earlier
                    versions are supported both by Oracle and other companies on a commercial basis.</p>

                <h3>Kotlin</h3>
                <p>Kotlin is a statically-typed programming language that runs on the Java virtual machine and also can be compiled
                    to JavaScript source code or uses the LLVM compiler infrastructure. Its primary development is from a
                    team of JetBrains programmers based in Saint Petersburg, Russia. While the syntax is not compatible with
                    Java, Kotlin is designed to interoperate with Java code and is reliant on Java code from the existing
                    Java Class Library, such as the collections framework.</p>
                <p>The name comes from Kotlin Island, near St. Petersburg. Andrey Breslav mentioned that the team decided to
                    name it after an island just like Java was named after the Indonesian island of Java.</p>
                <p>Kotlin is being promoted by Google for Android:Therefore, at Google I/O 2017 it was declared as one of the
                    official programming languages to develop Android applications along with Java and C++.</p>

                <h3>Swift</h3>
                <p>Swift is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm, compiled programming language developed by Apple Inc. for iOS,
                    macOS, watchOS, tvOS, and Linux. Swift is designed to work with Apple's Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks
                    and the large body of existing Objective-C (ObjC) code written for Apple products. It is built with the
                    open source LLVM compiler framework and has been included in Xcode since version 6. On platforms other
                    than Linux, it uses the Objective-C runtime library which allows C, Objective-C, C++ and Swift code to
                    run within one program.</p>
                <p>Apple intended Swift to support many core concepts associated with Objective-C, notably dynamic dispatch,
                    widespread late binding, extensible programming and similar features, but "safer" (easier to catch software
                    bugs); Swift has features addressing some common programming errors like null pointers and provides syntactic
                    sugar to help avoid the pyramid of doom. Swift supports the concept of protocol extensibility, an extensibility
                    system that can be applied to types, structs and classes, which Apple promotes as a real change in programming
                    paradigms they term "protocol-oriented programming".</p>
                <p>Swift was introduced at Apple's 2014 Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). It underwent an upgrade to version
                    1.2 during 2014 and a more major upgrade to Swift 2 at WWDC 2015. Initially a proprietary language, version
                    2.2 was made open-source software under the Apache License 2.0 on December 3, 2015, for Apple's platforms
                    and Linux.</p>
                <p>In March 2017, Swift made the top 10 in the monthly TIOBE index ranking of popular programming languages.</p>

                <h3>Objective-C</h3>
                <p>Objective-C is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language that adds Smalltalk-style messaging
                    to the C programming language. It was the main programming language used by Apple for the OS X and iOS
                    operating systems, and their respective application programming interfaces (APIs) Cocoa and Cocoa Touch
                    prior to the introduction of Swift.</p>
                <p>The programming language Objective-C was originally developed in the early 1980s. It was selected as the
                    main language used by NeXT for its NeXTSTEP operating system, from which OS X and iOS are derived. Portable
                    Objective-C programs that do not use the Cocoa or Cocoa Touch libraries, or those using parts that may
                    be ported or reimplemented for other systems, can also be compiled for any system supported by GNU Compiler
                    Collection (GCC) or Clang.</p>
                <p>Objective-C source code 'implementation' program files usually have .m filename extensions, while Objective-C
                    'header/interface' files have .h extensions, the same as C header files. Objective-C++ files are denoted
                    with a .mm file extension.</p>
